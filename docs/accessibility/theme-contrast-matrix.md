# Theme Contrast Matrix

## Executive Summary

This matrix audits every declared theme scope in `src/styles/theme/base.css` and `src/styles/theme/variants.css` against the standard text-to-surface pairings used by the design tokens. The sweep covers 13 theme scopes and 13 pairings per scope, with WCAG source-over alpha compositing applied before relative luminance and contrast calculations.

AA status: all audited themes pass. Open AA failures remain in . A contextual AA risk also remains where `--foreground` is reused on `--card` in `.theme-forest`.

## Coverage

- Theme sources: `src/styles/theme/base.css`, `src/styles/theme/variants.css`
- Pairings audited: `foreground/background`, `card-foreground/card`, `popover-foreground/popover`, `primary-foreground/primary`, `secondary-foreground/secondary`, `accent-foreground/accent`, `muted-foreground/muted`, `sidebar-foreground/sidebar`, `sidebar-primary-foreground/sidebar-primary`, `sidebar-accent-foreground/sidebar-accent`, `muted-foreground/background`, `muted-foreground/card`, `foreground/card`
- Thresholds: AA `>= 4.5:1` for normal text, AAA `>= 7:1`
- Out of scope for this matrix: gradients, images, charts, borders, non-text contrast, and focus indicators. Those stay in the main audit report.

## Method

- Token values were resolved from theme declarations with `:root` fallbacks.
- Alpha colors were composited with source-over math before luminance and contrast calculations.
- Surface tokens with translucency, such as popovers, were composited against their parent surface stack.
- This matrix treats token pairings as normal text by default. Large-text exceptions still need component-level verification where applicable.
